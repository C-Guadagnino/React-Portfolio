            I am a recent Hack-Reactor 19-week Software Engineering Bootcamp graduate,<br />
            who is a results-oriented and people focused, as well I am an adaptable <br />
            software engineer who loves the ever-changing programming landscape and learning<br />
            new tools, editors, programming languages, and frameworks to create useful software<br />
            for users I am excited to work in software engineering due to my love of learning <br />
            new skills. This is a field that allows for upwards growth in terms of career and <br />
            technical skills, and that prospect is very exciting to me. As someone who used <br />
            to work in the health-care field, adaptability is something I have grown to love, <br />
            and is something I will hope to use to leverage my way into a successful career as a software engineer.<br />

            Technical Skills: JavaScript, Python, Django 4, React.js, Redux, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Heroku, JSON <br />
